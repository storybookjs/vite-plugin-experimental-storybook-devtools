 * is why the memo is keyed on `process.cwd()` rather than on a parameter.
 *

 * its result synchronously and has no async entry point to await from: a
 * Next.js `route.ts` re-exports its `GET`/`POST`/`DELETE` handlers directly
 * from that call, so it can't become async without breaking that public
